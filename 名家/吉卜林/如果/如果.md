    如果 

   ①这是吉卜林写给他12岁儿子的诗

   如果在众人六神无主之时，

   你镇定自若而不是人云亦云；

   如果被众人猜忌怀疑时，

   你能自信如常而不去枉加辩论；

   如果你有梦想，

   又能不迷失自我；

   如果你有神思，

   又不至于走火入魔；

   如果在成功之中能不忘形于色，

   而在灾难之后也勇于咀嚼苦果；

   如果看到自己追求的美好破灭为一摊零碎的瓦砾，

   也不说放弃；

   如果你辛苦劳作，

   已是功成名就，

   为了新目标，

   你依旧冒险一搏，

   哪怕功名成乌有；

   如果你跟村夫交谈而不变谦恭之态，

   和王侯散步而不露谄媚之颜；

   如果他人的爱情左右不了你，

   如果你与任何人为伍都能卓然独立；

   如果昏惑的骚扰动摇不了你的意志，

   你能等自己平心静气再做答时……

   那么，你的修养就会如天地般博大，而你，就是个真正的男子汉了，我的儿子！

   If——

   By Rudyard Kipling

   If you can keep your head when all about you

   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;

   If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

   But make allowance for their doubting too;

   If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

   Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,

   Or being hated don’t give way to hating,

   And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

   If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;

   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;

   If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

   And treat those two impostors just the same;

   If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken

   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

   Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

   And stoop and build’ em up with worn out tools;

   If you can make one heap of all your winnings

   And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss

   And lose, and start again at your beginnings

   And never breathe a word about your loss;

   If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

   To serve your turn long after they are gone,

   And so hold on when there is nothing in you

   Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”

   If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

   Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch;

   If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;

   If all men count with you, but none too much;

   If you can fill the unforgiving minute

   With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run——

   Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,

   And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
